# Data Analysis Portfolio

Hello!!!

Welcome to this portfolio. My name is Ebenezer Bediam Nonbo, and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualisation, presentation skills, etc… A majority of my projects are done using R and Python programming languages. Some of the most used packages are: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python and: Ggplot2, Dplyr, Caret, Plotly, Stringr, Tidyr, Readr, Shiny in R.
In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let’s get started!

# About Me & My Data Journey

I currently work as a freelance strategic advisor helping companies, consultancies, organisations and start-ups to make more profit using tools such as: macro & microeconomics, data analysis (econometrics, statistics, machine learning), market research, business intelligence and financial analysis.

My data journey began in 2019 after my BSc in mathematics at the University of Douala. This discovery of the many advantages of transforming data into information to give companies a considerable competitive edge led me to take a Master's degree in mathematical modelling in economics and finance, as well as several online certificates in a variety of fields.

My background in mathematics made it much easier for me to learn, integrate and use the various software programmes that were essential to achieving my objectives. I officially began my data education with coursera with their: Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r?), followed by: IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst). 

# Projects Description Examples

1. Customer Segmentation Project

A customer segmentation project involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups or segments based on certain criteria such as demographics, behavior, purchasing patterns, or preferences. The goal is to better understand customers' needs and behaviors in order to tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to specific segments, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and increasing revenue.

2. Titanic Data Exploration Project

Titanic data exploration project typically involves analyzing the dataset related to the passengers aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912. This dataset is often used as a learning tool in data science and machine learning for tasks such as classification and regression.

3. Identifying Product Bundles Project

The objective of this project is to identify product bundles or combinations that are frequently purchased together by customers in a retail dataset. By leveraging association rule mining techniques in R, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns in customer purchase behavior, which can inform marketing strategies, cross-selling opportunities, and inventory management decisions.

4. Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model in R to detect credit card fraud effectively. By analyzing historical transaction data, the goal is to create a robust model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and minimize false positives.

5. Uber Data Analysis Project

The aim of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber trip data using the R programming language. Uber has become a significant player in the transportation industry, and analyzing its trip data can provide valuable insights into rider behavior, demand patterns, and geographical trends.
