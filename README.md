#Data analysis portfolio!!!

Hello!
Welcome to this portfolio. My name is Ebenezer Bediam Nonbo, and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualisation, presentation skills, etc… A majority of my projects are done using R and Python programming languages. Some of the most used packages are: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python and: Ggplot2, Dplyr, Caret, Plotly, Stringr, Tidyr, Readr, Shiny in R.
In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let’s get started!

#About Me & My Data Journey

I currently work as a freelance strategic advisor helping companies, consultancies, organisations and start-ups to make more profit using tools such as: macro & microeconomics, data analysis (econometrics, statistics, machine learning), market research, business intelligence and financial analysis.
My data journey began in 2019 after my BSc in mathematics at the University of Douala. This discovery of the many advantages of transforming data into information to give companies a considerable competitive edge led me to take a Master's degree in mathematical modelling in economics and finance, as well as several online certificates in a variety of fields.
My background in mathematics made it much easier for me to learn, integrate and use the various software programmes that were essential to achieving my objectives. I officially began my data education with coursera with their: Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization (Here!!!), followed by: IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (Here!!!).
